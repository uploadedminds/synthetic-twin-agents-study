# Empirical Study: The Potential of Synthetic Twin Agents for Personalized Behavioural Interventions at Scale

Evidence from a Proof-of-Concept Study Using Personality-Tailored Advertisements

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis code and data for a study investigating the potential of synthetic twin agents for personalized behavioural interventions. The study uses personality-tailored advertisements as a proof-of-concept application.

The study employs the **[edsl](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl)** package for administering surveys to synthetic twin participants, enabling controlled experimental designs with AI-generated participants that mirror human behavioral patterns.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your system

### Environment Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:bandhlabs/personalized-beh-sci-interventions-study.git
   cd personalized-beh-sci-interventions-study
   ```

2. Create and activate the conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate synthetic-twin-agents-env
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
   
   Add the following to your `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   EXPECTED_PARROT_API_KEY=your_expected_parrot_api_key_here
   ```
   
   **Note**: These API keys are required for generating synthetic twin participants using the edsl package for survey administration.

## Data Description

The analysis uses the following datasets located in the `data/` directory:

- `prolific_participants_dataset.csv`: Human participant (Prolific) data
- `filtered_participants_dataset.csv`: Human participants who passed quality checks (see human-participants-analysis.ipynb for details on filtering criteria)
- `synthetic_participants_gpt.csv`: Synthetic twin participants generated using GPT-4o
- `synthetic_participants_gemini.csv`: Synthetic twin participants generated using Gemini-1.5 Flash

## Running the Analysis

### 1. Human Participants Analysis

Navigate to the human participants analysis:
```bash
cd analysis/human-participants
jupyter notebook human-participants-analysis.ipynb
```

This notebook analyzes the behavior and responses of human participants in the study.

### 2. Synthetic Participants Analysis

Navigate to the synthetic participants analysis:
```bash
cd analysis/synthetic-participants
```

Run the analysis for different LLM models:

**For GPT-based synthetic participants:**
```bash
jupyter notebook analysis_gpt.ipynb
```

**For Gemini-based synthetic participants:**
```bash
jupyter notebook analysis_gemini.ipynb
```

These notebooks analyze the behavior and responses of synthetic participants generated by different language models.

### 3. Synthetic-Human Alignment Analysis

Navigate to the alignment analysis:
```bash
cd analysis/synth-human-alignment
jupyter notebook fishers_z-test.ipynb
```

This notebook performs Fisher's Z-test to compare the alignment between synthetic and human participants.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the conda environment:

1. **Environment creation fails**: Try updating conda first:
   ```bash
   conda update conda
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

2. **Package conflicts**: Remove the existing environment and recreate:
   ```bash
   conda env remove -n synthetic-twin-agents-env
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

3. **Jupyter notebook issues**: Ensure the environment is activated and install ipykernel:
   ```bash
   conda activate synthetic-twin-agents-env
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name synthetic-twin-agents-env --display-name "Synthetic Twin Agents"
   ```
